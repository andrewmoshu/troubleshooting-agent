I had built my PC about 6 months ago using all Cablemod cables including their 12VHPWR cable. My PSU is a MSI MPG-A1000G with a 12VHPWR port. My card is mounted vertically with no stress on the cable (\npic\n). The system was stable for ~3 months. But for the last 3 months I've had regular intermittent crashes while gaming (any game - from low gpu usage games to high gpu usage games). First crash usually occurs within first 10-15 mins of gaming load. Game audio would keep playing but the screen would go black. Only fix is to restart the PC. It really seemed like a software/driver issue at first. I tried a bunch of solutions: resetting my OC, reinstalling the graphics driver, replugging the cable, tweaking in game graphics settings, adjusting my pump and fan speeds. But none of them worked.\nRecently I did a\nreddit search\nand found a number of other users with the same issue with the cablemod 12VHPWR cable. So I decided to swap the cablemod cable with the stock MSI PSU cable - and I've not had a single crash in a week! Apparently some cablemod cables have issues with the sense pins that can cause this black screen problem.\nIt was quite frustrating spending hours trying to solve this issue and the frequent crashes while gaming. If cablemod/other third party cable companies see this post, I urge you to send out an email notifying existing customers that this can be a problem. There may be other customers dealing with the same issue without any idea of the right fix.\nArchived post.

After the screen goes Black an the fans speed up, I can only hold the off button to shut the PC down. I saw multiple persons on different forums having the same issue, but the reason seems different, so maybe some here can help me.\nMy situation: I had a self build PC for about 4 years (CPU: Ryzen 9 3900X, GPU: RTX 2070). I wanted to upgrade my GPU and bought an RTX 4070 TI Super. Now, after about one month, the problem appeared. Oddly enough it never happened while gaming (or rendering videos). Most of the time it happens while doing something relatively harmless (e.g. browsing through the Internet). Sometimes I didn't even looked at the screen, but was at my phone, when I heard the fans speed up.\nThe most common problem reasons were temperature and Power issue. I updated my GPU driver and checkt the temp via HW monitor, and it never reached a critical point (always under 60\u00b0C). I have a 850 Watt Corsair TX-M Series TX850M. This should provide enough power for the GPU so this probably also isn't the problem.\nAny suggestions, what could fix this?", "https://www.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/1ip73d4/5090_and_melting_cables_what_do_we_do_in_the/": "Go to nvidia\nr/nvidia\n\u2022\nEbisorosh\n5090 and melting cables: what do we do in the meantime?\nHe all,\nWith the recent reports from der8auer and other tech YouTubers about the RTX 5090's power cables melting, I'm sure many of us are concerned about our setups. I'm currently using a Corsair HX1200i PSU with the included cable and had no issues for the 10 to 20 hours of gaming so far. But I'm wondering what steps we should take to ensure my systems' safety for the time being (aside from making sure the cable is fully connected) are some ideas I've been considering:\nAlternative Cables: Should we look into third-party cables with better specifications? However, it's worth noting that even high-quality cables like those from CableMod have been involved in some reported issues.\nPSU Upgrade: Is switching to a different PSU model or brand necessary? The HX1200i is generally well-regarded, but are there safer options available?\nThermal Monitoring: Would it be wise to borrow or invest in a thermal camera to conduct our own stress tests? This could help identify potential hotspots before they become dangerous.\nRegular Inspections: Should we implement a routine of checking our power connectors for any signs of wear or damage?\nUndervolting: Could slightly undervolting the GPU reduce the risk without significantly impacting performance?\nWait for Official Statement: Should we hold off on any major changes until NVIDIA or PSU manufacturers release official statements or solutions?\nWhat do you think is the most prudent course of action? Has anyone here taken any specific measures to address these concerns? I'd love to hear your thoughts and experiences. I'm just a bit worried to just simply game.\ncheers", "https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/yuqhag/rtx_4090_black_screen_issues/": "Go to buildapc\nr/buildapc\nr/buildapc\nPlanning on building a computer but need some advice?

Happenings 2-3 into windows starting up (if your lucky to make it there).\nEdit: I updated to 526.98 and nothing has changed.\nI\u2019ve noticed the gpu fans and lights turn off but the computer is still on. Screen turns off afterwards. Few minutes later, computer turns off. I restart everything and it\u2019s the same situation.\nNote: software and firmware is updated to the latest version.\nWhat\u2019s interesting is, when your connected to the Integrated graphics, everything seems to be working fine. No crashes or black screens. Seems to be a gpu issue but what can it be?\nEdit: As of August 14, 2023 my graphic card is working and I am able to game on it! BUT I still experience minor crashes and glitches directly related to my graphics card. I\u2019ve updated every software on my PC and those were my results. I hope others found a way to utilize and make the best of this expensive card! For the money: the headaches associated with this card wasn\u2019t worth it in my opinion.\nEdit: As of Nov 2023 my graphic card is giving me issues again. Flickering here and there. I brought a new monitor to isolate the issue but again - the flickering is still present. The glitches are annoying. So I spoke to customer service who approved a RMA. I will update you all when I receive the new replacement (hopefully it\u2019s brand new)\u2026 if anyone has done a RMA on a 4090 - please share your experience. Thanks. I hope this is helpful."}
